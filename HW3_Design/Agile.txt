 Complete the following tasks:
1. Complete these user stories:
    * As a vanilla git power-user that has never seen GiggleGit before, I want to…:
                * carry over the vast majority of my skills from vanilla 
                git and avoid feeling lost.

        * As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want to…
                * Easily look through their projects, as well as their meme tastes. 

    

2. Create a third user story, one task for this user story, and two associated tickets.
    USER STORY:  As a person with very limited coding experience, I want to 
    be able to use GiggleGit without extensive research or headaches, so I can quickly
    get started and collaborate with my team. 

    TASK: Create a tutorial and manual to guide users 

    TICKET 1: Create an intuitive manual for non-technical users 
        * We need to implement a manual command that is easy to use and helpful 
        to users with limited coding experience 

    TICKET 2: Create a tutorial to run on first download 
        * Implement a step-by-step tutorial to help new users with basic functionality, but 
        make sure it is skippable so that returning users do not feel patronized. 


3. This is not a user story. Why not? What is it?
    As a user I want to be able to authenticate on a new machine 
        * This is not a user story because it is too technically focused, lacks a type of 
        user, and does not have a reason for the feature being implemented.  This is instead closer to a Task.
